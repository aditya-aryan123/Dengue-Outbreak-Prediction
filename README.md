# Dengue-Outbreak-Prediction

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the total_cases label for each (city, year, weekofyear) in the test set. There are two cities, San Juan and Iquitos, with test data for each city spanning 5 and 3 years respectively

## Description of Data

Climate Data:
 The climate data includes temperature, perception and vegetationdata of Sun Juan gathered from various sources from 1990 to 2008. The climate dataset has been combined   from four open datasets of US National Oceanic and At-mospheric Administration (Driven Data, 2017).

Dengue Data:
 This includes total cases of dengue by week of the year. The datasetincludes the dengue cases of San Juan from 1990 to 2008. The dataset is used fordeveloping         prediction model.
 
Test Data:
 The dataset contains the dengue cases data with climate parameters from2009 to 2013. The dataset is used as test data for checking the efficiency of the de-veloped model.
